ES6/7 for React Curriculum
========

##Objective
Refactor an application to use ES6/7 from ES5.

## Notes
If you're coming from the [React Fundamentals](http://courses.reactjsprogram.com/courses/reactjsfundamentals) course, you're all set to continue to the next paragraph. If not, I recommend checking out the finished product that we'll be refactoring. It can be found [HERE](http://reactjsprogram.com/React-Fundamentals-Project). Also if you'd like more React practice, feel free go and do the curriculum for React Fundamentals. It's free and located [HERE](https://github.com/ReactjsProgram/react-fundamentals-curriculum).

## Instructions
There are two branches. The "master" branch and the "solution" branch. The "master" branch will contain the code you're going to refactor. Since there's really no best way to refactor, there aren't going to be any steps for how to approach it. I recommend just going file by file and if you get stuck, check the "solution" branch to see my implementation.

## Step 1:
Fork this repo. Clone your fork. npm install. npm run start. Start refactoring.
